                    Daring Doughnuts was founded by two best friends who love creating something that makes people go "WOW". Between the two friends, over 15 years has been invested in baking and pastry arts, with 5 years going into the creation of experimental doughnuts. Casey and Alex spend most of their time drafting up new ideas for flavors, as they have since they started the business in 2010 shortly after graduating college.

                    Located in Middletown, DE, the pair have been making strides in their business and hope to dazzle you with their latest creations. In 2012, Daring Doughnuts took home 3 prizes across various local fairs for "Best Pastry", "Most Creative Doughnut", and "Best New Bakery", landing a spot on the front page of the Daily Town Newspaper for their success.
